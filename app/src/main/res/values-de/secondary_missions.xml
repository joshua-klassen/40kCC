        <item>In this mission, players must set up one additional objective marker in No Man’s Land.
            Unless the Chosen Battlefield mission rule is also in effect, before setting up this new
            objective marker, players must first move the objective marker in the centre of the
            battlefield 6" directly towards one of the corners of the battlefield (if No Man’s Land
            touches any of the comers of the battlefield, you must move the objective marker towards
            one of those corners). Players then set up the new objective marker 6" from the centre
            of the battlefield towards the diagonally opposite corner of the battlefield to the
            previously moved objective marker.

        <item>In this mission:
            Players’ units with the Infiltrators ability cannot be set up within range of an
            objective marker that is either in No Man’s Land or their opponent’s deployment zone.
            Players’ units with the Scouts ability that make a move before the first turn begins
            cannot end that move within range of an objective marker that is either in No Man’s Land
            or their opponent’s deployment zone.
            If any rule is used to redeploy a unit, that rule cannot be used to set up that unit
            within range of an objective marker in No Man’s Land.
            When a player’s Reserves and Strategic Reserves units are set up on the battlefield,
            they cannot be set up within range of an objective marker that is either in No Man’s
            Land or their opponent’s deployment zone.

        <item>In this mission, objective markers are not placed as shown on the Deployment card
            drawn. Instead, players roll off at the start of the Place Objective Markers step, then
            alternate setting up objective markers, one at a time, starting with the winner of the
            roll off.
            One objective marker must be placed wholly within each deployment zone, and the
            remaining objective markers must be placed wholly within No Man’s Land, as shown on the
            Deployment card drawn. Objective markers must be placed more than 6" away from any
            battlefield edge and more than 9" away from all other objective markers.
            If for whatever reason it is not possible to set up an objective marker as described
            above, it is not placed on the battlefield.
            If any rules require players to set up additional objective markers (e.g. Hidden
            Supplies) during the Place Objective Markers step, players set them up as described on
            this Mission Rule card.
            If any rules instruct players to remove one or more objective markers, do so after
            setting them all up.

        <item>In this mission, if a player controls an objective marker at the end of their Command
            phase, that objective marker remains under their control, even if they have no models
            within range of it, unless their opponent controls it at the end of any subsequent
            Command phase.

        <item>In this mission, if a player is using Tactical Missions, then each time that player
            determines which Secondary Mission cards are active for them, if they have fewer than 3
            active Secondary Mission cards, that player draws from their Secondary Mission deck
            until they have 3 Secondary Mission cards.
            In this mission, if a player is using Fixed Missions, then in addition to the 2 Fixed
            Mission cards, that player will also draw cards from their Secondary Mission deck during
            the battle. At the end of the Select Secondary Missions step, that player should
            retrieve their Secondary Mission deck, remove all the Fixed Mission cards they did not
            select at the start of that step, then shuffle the remaining cards. Then, at the start
            of each of that player’s Command phases, if that player has fewer than 3 active
            Secondary Mission cards (including their Fixed Mission cards), they draw from their
            Secondary Mission deck until they have 3 Secondary Mission cards. That player has access
            to the New Orders Strategem, and can spend CP to use it after drawing their Secondary
            Mission cards if they wish (remember that Fixed Mission cards cannot be discarded for
            any reason).

        <item>In this mission, until the start of the third battle round, each time a Reserves or
            Strategic Reserves unit wishes to arrive on the battlefield, the controlling player must
            make a Reserves roll for it. To do so, that player rolls one D6: on a 3+, that unit
            arrives on the battlefield; otherwise, the Reserves roll fails and that unit does not
            arrive this turn.

            new Mission Rule cards.
            If either of these new Mission Rule cards is Chilling rain, discard that Mission Rule
            card and draw 2 additional new Mission Rule cards (for a total of 3 new Mission Rule
            cards).
            Apply all the drawn Mission Rule cards to the battle.
